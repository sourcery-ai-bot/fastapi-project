# Summary 

This API was developed as part of a course I completed on freecodecamp.org's youtube channel titled [Python API Development - Comprehensive Course for Beginners](https://youtu.be/0sOvCWFmrtA). 

# Deployment
![Heroku](https://heroku-badge.herokuapp.com/?app=heroku-badge)

The application is currently deployed using Heroku and can be found [here](https://fastapi-timmyb-blog.herokuapp.com/). The swagger docs for the API are available [here](https://fastapi-timmyb-blog.herokuapp.com/docs). If the badge is showing as 'Heroku: Failed' then its likely because I put it in maintenance mode for one reason or another. 

By the way, shout out to https://github.com/pussinboots/heroku-badge for the badge!
